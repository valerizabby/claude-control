<h1 align="center">Claude Control</h1>

<p align="center">
  A native macOS desktop app for monitoring and managing multiple <a href="https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code">Claude Code</a> sessions in real time.
</p>

When you're running several Claude Code instances across different repos and worktrees, it's hard to keep track of what each one is doing. Claude Control auto-discovers all running sessions and gives you a single dashboard with live status, git changes, conversation previews, and quick actions — without leaving the app.

![Dashboard](docs/screenshot.png)

## Features

- **Auto-discovery** — Detects all running `claude` CLI processes via the process table, uses hook events for authoritative PID-to-JSONL mapping with mtime-based fallback
- **Live status** — Classifies each session as Working, Idle, Waiting (needs input), Errored, or Finished using real-time hook events from Claude Code, with CPU/JSONL heuristic fallback
- **Git integration** — Shows branch name, changed files, additions/deletions, and detects open pull requests via `gh`
- **PR status badges** — Live CI check rollup (passing/failing/pending), review decision, unresolved threads, merge conflicts, and merged/closed state
- **Task context** — Extracts Linear issue titles and descriptions from MCP tool results to show what each session is working on
- **Conversation preview** — Shows the last assistant message, active tool, and user prompt for each session
- **Approve/reject from dashboard** — Approve or reject tool-use permission prompts directly from the dashboard without switching to the terminal
- **Keyboard shortcuts** — Number keys (1-9) to select sessions, Tab/Shift+Tab to cycle, A/X to approve/reject, Enter to focus terminal, E/G/F/P for editor/git/finder/PR
- **Desktop notifications** — Native macOS notifications when sessions finish working or need attention (configurable)
- **Notification sounds** — Subtle two-tone chime on status transitions (configurable)
- **Quick actions** — One-click buttons to focus the terminal tab, open your editor, git GUI, Finder, or PR link for any session
- **Multiple terminal support** — Full tab-level control for iTerm2, Terminal.app, kitty, WezTerm, and cmux; basic support for Ghostty, Warp, and Alacritty (see [Terminal support](#terminal-support))
- **tmux integration** — Run sessions inside tmux with per-project session grouping or manual session selection; approve/reject without terminal focus via `send-keys`
- **Configurable tools** — Choose your preferred terminal, code editor (VS Code, Cursor, Zed, etc.), git GUI (Fork, Sublime Merge, etc.), and browser (Chrome, Arc, Safari, etc.)
- **New session creation** — Create new Claude Code sessions with git worktree support, repo browsing, and custom initial prompts
- **PR workflow** — Send `/create-pr` to idle sessions and see PR links once created
- **Worktree cleanup** — Remove worktrees, branches, and kill sessions with a two-step confirmation flow
- **Multi-monitor support** — Target which display apps open on

## Requirements

- **macOS** (uses AppleScript for terminal integration, native folder picker, etc.)
- **Node.js** >= 18 (LTS 24 recommended — see `.node-version`)
- [**Claude Code CLI**](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) installed and running
- A supported terminal (see [Terminal support](#terminal-support) below)
- [**tmux**](https://github.com/tmux/tmux) for tmux integration (optional)
- [**GitHub CLI**](https://cli.github.com/) (`gh`) for PR detection (optional)

A `.node-version` file is included for version managers like [fnm](https://github.com/Schniz/fnm) and [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm). With auto-switching enabled, both will pick up the correct version when you `cd` into the project. Otherwise, run `fnm use` or `nvm use`.

## Install from DMG

Download the latest `.dmg` from the [Releases](../../releases) page, open it, and drag the app to Applications. Both Apple Silicon and Intel builds are available.

## Build from source

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/sverrirsig/claude-control.git
cd claude-control

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run in development mode (hot-reload)
npm run electron:dev

# Or build a distributable DMG
npm run electron:build
```

The development server runs on port 3200. The Electron shell loads it automatically.

### Scripts

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `npm run electron:dev` | Dev mode with hot-reload (Next.js + Electron) |
| `npm run electron:build` | Production build → DMG + ZIP in `dist/` |
| `npm run electron:pack` | Production build → unpacked app in `dist/` |
| `npm run dev` | Next.js dev server only (no Electron shell) |
| `npm run build` | Next.js production build only |
| `npm run test` | Run unit tests (Vitest) |
| `npm run test:watch` | Run tests in watch mode |
| `npm run lint` | Run ESLint |
| `npm run typecheck` | Run TypeScript type checking |

## How it works

### Session discovery

1. Finds all processes named `claude` via `ps`
2. Filters out Claude Desktop (only CLI instances)
3. Gets each process's working directory via `lsof`
4. Reads hook event files (`~/.claude-control/events/<pid>.json`) for authoritative PID→JSONL mapping and session status
5. Falls back to mtime-based JSONL discovery for sessions without hook events
6. Reads the tail of each JSONL file to extract conversation preview and task context

Hook events are installed automatically into `~/.claude/settings.json` on first launch. Each Claude process writes its status, session ID, and transcript path to a `<pid>.json` file on every lifecycle event.

### Status classification

**Primary (hook events):**

| Status | Hook Event |
|---|---|
| **Working** | `UserPromptSubmit`, `SubagentStart`, `PostToolUseFailure` |
| **Waiting** | `PermissionRequest` (overridden to Working if CPU > 15%) |
| **Idle** | `SessionStart`, `Stop` |
| **Finished** | `SessionEnd` |

**Fallback (heuristic, when hooks unavailable):**

| Status | Condition |
|---|---|
| **Working** | JSONL modified recently AND CPU > 5%, or CPU > 15% |
| **Waiting** | Pending tool use (after 3s settle) or asking for user input |
| **Idle** | Process alive, low activity |
| **Errored** | Last message contains error indicators |
| **Finished** | Process no longer running |

### Architecture

```
Electron shell (macOS native window)
    ↓
Browser (SWR polls /api/sessions every 1s)
    ↓
Next.js API Routes (standalone server)
    ↓
┌──────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  discovery.ts  →  process-utils.ts       │  ps, lsof
│                →  hooks-reader.ts        │  <pid>.json → status + transcript
│                →  paths.ts               │  ~/.claude/projects mapping
│                →  session-reader.ts       │  JSONL parsing
│                →  git-info.ts            │  git status, diff, PR detection
│                →  status-classifier.ts   │  Heuristic fallback
└──────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

No database — all state is derived from the process table, hook event files, and JSONL transcripts on every request.

## Terminal support

Claude-control auto-detects which terminal each Claude session is running in by walking the process tree. Capabilities vary by terminal:

### Full support

These terminals support tab-level focus, text input, and keystroke sending — clicking "focus" in the dashboard switches to the exact tab running that session.

| Terminal | Focus method | How it works |
|---|---|---|
| [**Terminal.app**](https://support.apple.com/guide/terminal/) | AppleScript (TTY matching) | Matches tabs by TTY, uses System Events for keystrokes. Works out of the box. |
| [**iTerm2**](https://iterm2.com/) | iTerm API with AppleScript fallback | The API matches the exact TTY, including hotkey-window sessions. AppleScript fallback handles regular windows. Native `write text` for keystrokes. |
| [**kitty**](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/) | Remote control (Unix socket) | Uses `kitten @` IPC to resolve window by PID, then focus by window ID. Supports tmux-in-kitty matching. Requires configuration (see below). |
| [**WezTerm**](https://wezfurlong.org/wezterm/) | CLI (`wezterm cli`) | Uses `wezterm cli` to list panes, focus by pane ID, and send text directly. Works out of the box. |
| [**cmux**](https://cmux.dev/) | AppleScript (panel ID) | Reads cmux's native session JSON to resolve TTY → panel ID, then focuses via AppleScript. Works out of the box. |

#### iTerm2 hotkey window configuration

Hotkey-window tab focus requires **iTerm2 → Settings → General → Magic → Enable Python API**. If the API is disabled or unavailable, Claude Control silently uses the AppleScript fallback, which still handles regular iTerm windows but cannot see hotkey windows.

#### kitty configuration

kitty requires remote control to be enabled. Add the following to `~/.config/kitty/kitty.conf`:

```conf
allow_remote_control socket-only
listen_on unix:/tmp/kitty-{kitty_pid}
```

**You must restart kitty** after making these changes (`listen_on` is not reloaded on config refresh).

- **`allow_remote_control socket-only`** — Allows external programs to control kitty via the Unix socket, while preventing programs running *inside* kitty (e.g. scripts you run) from doing so. This is the recommended security setting.
- **`listen_on unix:/tmp/kitty-{kitty_pid}`** — Creates a socket at `/tmp/kitty-<pid>` that claude-control uses to send commands. The `{kitty_pid}` placeholder ensures each kitty instance gets its own socket.

To verify it's working, run this inside kitty:

```bash
kitten @ ls
```

If it outputs JSON with your windows and tabs, remote control is active. Without these settings, claude-control falls back to basic app activation (no tab selection).

### Basic support

These terminals are detected and can be activated, but focus goes to the app — not a specific tab. Text and keystrokes are sent via macOS System Events.

| Terminal | Notes |
|---|---|
| [**Ghostty**](https://ghostty.org/) | Has AppleScript support since v1.3 but lacks PID/TTY properties for tab matching ([#10756](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/issues/10756)). Full support expected when 1.4 ships. |
| [**Warp**](https://www.warp.dev/) | No tab-level IPC available. |
| [**Alacritty**](https://alacritty.org/) | No tabs by design — use tmux for multi-session workflows. |

> **Tip:** For any terminal with basic support, enabling **tmux integration** gives you full per-session control. Claude-control sends commands directly to tmux panes via `send-keys`, bypassing the terminal entirely.

### IDE terminals (VS Code, Cursor, Windsurf, JetBrains)

Sessions started in an IDE's built-in terminal are detected, and **Focus** brings the IDE window for the session's project to the front. It doesn't pick the terminal tab. The IDE gives no way to type into its terminal panel, and simulated keystrokes could end up in the editor instead. So without tmux, **Create PR**, **Quick Reply** and **approve/reject** show an error rather than sending.

To make every button work, run Claude inside tmux in the IDE terminal:

```bash
tmux new -A -s "$(basename "$PWD" | tr .: __)" claude
```

Or add a shell function to `~/.zshrc` (named `ccl` so it doesn't shadow the `cc` compiler):

```bash
ccl() { tmux new -A -s "$(basename "$PWD" | tr .: __)" claude "$@"; }
```

`-A` reattaches when a session for this folder already exists. In tmux, input goes to the pane through `send-keys`, and **Focus** selects the pane and raises the IDE window. For sessions created from the dashboard, turn on **Run in tmux** in Settings, or per session in the New Session dialog.

## First-time setup

On first launch, the app will ask you to select your code directory (the parent folder containing your git repos, e.g. `~/Code`). This is stored in `~/.claude-control/config.json` and used for the repo picker when creating new sessions.

You can add multiple code directories. The app scans up to two levels deep for git repositories.
